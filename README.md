# TermProjectCisc474

The project is written using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. The site's database is structured using MongoDB, keeping collections for users and each user's high score in each game mode.
Site Navigation:
To navigate, the user should click on the cards that show up on various pages of the site. When clicked, the card will flip, revealing an option. Clicking on a card a second time will take you to the selected page. 
Login:
Once the user enters the login page, they will see a page with two tabs - "Log In" & "Sign Up". Choosing the Log In tab will open a form that has a login page for inputting your stored information.
Choosing the Sign Up tab will open a similar form, but the user will also be asked for their email and to make a new password to create a new user.
Game 1:
The user will choose between a selection of settings to decide on a theme (Animals, Numbers, or Colors) and mode (Survival and Timed) for the game. Once chosen, the user will select a card with one of three difficulties -- "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard".
Afterwards, they will be shown a full array of cards. Clicking on cards will show an image that the player is expected to match with its identical pair somewhere on the board. If a wrong match is chosen three times, the game will end.
Game 2:
TBA
Settings:
Unlike the game pages of the site, the Settings page uses radio buttons. The user can set the site to Light Mode or Dark Mode depending on their preference. The selection will reset each time but the site theme will be remembered.

Hosting Locally:
Enter 'node app.js' into the terminal in the root directory of the project. Use a browser to navigate to 'http://localhost:8080/'. If you have any issues, use google chrome. Some users have mentioned issues using Mozilla Firefox that we would like to resolve in the future.
